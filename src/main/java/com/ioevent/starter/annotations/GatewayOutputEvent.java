/**
 * @GatewayOutputEvent annotation allowsto determine what path is taken through

 *                     Flows.a single Gateway could have multiple output flows.
 * @GatewayOutputEvent can be divided into two types, the Exclusive Gateway and
 *                     the Parallel Gateway: for the parallel we set the value
 *                     of parallel to true and define the list of output
 *                     branches @OutputEvent where to produce the event
 *                     simultaneously , for the exclusive we set the value of
 *                     exclusive to true and define the list of @OutputEvent
 *                     where the method will produce the event to the output
 *                     with the same key of the IOResponse output key .
